## Instructions

{type: instructions}

The final phase involves comprehensive evaluation of your fine-tuned model. You'll compare its performance against the original base model to determine whether fine-tuning achieved your objectives.

**Your Tasks:**
1. Design evaluation methodology
2. Compare model responses side-by-side
3. Measure quantitative improvements
4. Document lessons learned and next steps

## Evaluation Methodology

{type: information, icon: "chart-line", title: "Assessment Framework"}

**Evaluation Dimensions:**

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Response relevance and accuracy
- Politeness and empathy scores
- Response length and completeness
- Customer satisfaction indicators
- Task completion rates

**Qualitative Assessment:**
- Communication tone and style
- Emotional intelligence demonstration
- Professional language usage
- Cultural sensitivity and inclusivity
- Overall user experience quality

**Comparison Approach:**
- Side-by-side response evaluation
- Blind testing with human reviewers
- A/B testing with real scenarios
- Statistical significance testing

## Response Comparison

{type: information, icon: "balance-scale", title: "Base Model vs Fine-Tuned Model"}

**Test Scenario:** Customer frustrated with product malfunction

**Customer Input:** "I'm really upset! Your product broke after just one week and now I can't complete my work project. This is completely unacceptable!"

**Base Model Response:**
"Check the warranty information in your product documentation. If the product is defective, submit a warranty claim through our website."

**Fine-Tuned Model Response:**
"I'm so sorry to hear about this frustrating experience, and I completely understand how upsetting this must be, especially when it's affecting your important work project. A product failing after just one week is definitely not acceptable, and I want to make this right for you immediately. Let me personally help you with a fast-track warranty replacement and see if we can expedite shipping so you can get back to your project as soon as possible."

## Evaluation Scoring

{type: form}

### Response Quality Assessment

**Rate the improvement in empathy (1-10 scale):**
{type: select, options: ["1-2 (No improvement)", "3-4 (Slight improvement)", "5-6 (Moderate improvement)", "7-8 (Significant improvement)", "9-10 (Excellent improvement)"]}

**Rate the improvement in helpfulness (1-10 scale):**
{type: select, options: ["1-2 (No improvement)", "3-4 (Slight improvement)", "5-6 (Moderate improvement)", "7-8 (Significant improvement)", "9-10 (Excellent improvement)"]}

**Rate the improvement in professionalism (1-10 scale):**
{type: select, options: ["1-2 (No improvement)", "3-4 (Slight improvement)", "5-6 (Moderate improvement)", "7-8 (Significant improvement)", "9-10 (Excellent improvement)"]}

### Overall Assessment

**Has fine-tuning achieved the primary objective?**
{type: select, options: ["Yes, completely", "Yes, mostly", "Partially", "No, minimal improvement", "No, performance decreased"]}
