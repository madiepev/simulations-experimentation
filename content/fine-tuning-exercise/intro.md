# Introduction

{type: introduction}

Welcome to the Fine-Tuning AI Models interactive exercise. In this hands-on simulation, you'll learn the complete process of enhancing AI models through supervised fine-tuning.

## Learning Objective

{type: information, icon: "bullseye", title: "What You'll Learn"}

Master the complete process of fine-tuning AI models and learn to evaluate whether a fine-tuned model delivers superior performance compared to baseline models.

You'll gain practical experience with:
- Evaluating base model performance
- Preparing training datasets for fine-tuning
- Implementing supervised fine-tuning workflows
- Comparing model performance before and after fine-tuning

## Mission Brief

{type: mission_brief, classification: "SUPERVISED FINE-TUNING", difficulty: "TUTORIAL"}

### Mission: Polite Chatbot Development

You've been tasked with developing a customer service chatbot that maintains exceptional politeness while delivering helpful, accurate responses. The current base model sometimes responds with curt or impersonal messages.

**Mission Parameters:**
- **Target:** Polite Customer Service Bot
- **Method:** Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
- **Challenge:** Balance politeness with functionality
- **Goal:** Evaluate fine-tuning effectiveness

**Scenario Context:**
The customer service team has reported that the current AI assistant sometimes provides responses that, while technically accurate, lack the warmth and empathy expected in customer interactions. Your job is to fine-tune the model to improve its communication style while maintaining accuracy.
