## Instructions

{type: instructions}

Now that you've identified the areas for improvement, it's time to prepare the training dataset. Quality data is crucial for successful fine-tuning - your model will only be as good as the examples you provide.

**Your Tasks:**
1. Review dataset quality criteria
2. Select appropriate conversation examples
3. Prioritize data categories by importance
4. Plan your data collection strategy

## Dataset Quality Criteria

{type: information, icon: "database", title: "Essential Dataset Characteristics"}

For effective fine-tuning, your dataset must meet these criteria:

**Quality Standards:**
- **Relevance:** Examples should match your target use case
- **Diversity:** Cover various scenarios and conversation types
- **Balance:** Represent different customer emotions and situations
- **Accuracy:** Responses should be factually correct and appropriate
- **Consistency:** Maintain uniform style and tone across examples
- **Completeness:** Include sufficient context for understanding

**Size Considerations:**
- Minimum: 100-500 high-quality examples for basic improvements
- Recommended: 1,000-5,000 examples for robust performance
- Advanced: 10,000+ examples for comprehensive fine-tuning

## Training Data Selection

{type: selection, multiple: true, title: "Choose Training Examples"}

Which types of conversation examples should be included in your training dataset?

- Customer complaints handled with empathy and professionalism
- Technical support requests with helpful, detailed responses
- Product inquiries answered in a friendly, informative manner
- Billing questions addressed with patience and clarity
- Feature requests acknowledged with appreciation and guidance
- Frustrated customers calmed through understanding responses
- Complex problems broken down into manageable steps
- Follow-up questions answered proactively

## Data Prioritization

{type: ranking, title: "Rank Data Categories by Priority"}

Drag and drop to prioritize these data categories from most important (top) to least important (bottom) for your fine-tuning objectives:

```
Empathetic responses to customer frustration
Professional handling of product complaints  
Clear explanations of technical concepts
Proactive follow-up and additional assistance
Personalized greetings and conversation starters
Graceful handling of requests outside scope
Positive reinforcement and encouragement
Efficient problem resolution workflows
```

## Data Collection Strategy

{type: form}

### Source Planning

**Where will you source your training examples?**
{type: select, options: ["Existing customer service transcripts", "Manually created examples", "Combination of real and synthetic data", "External datasets from similar domains"]}

**How will you ensure response quality?**
{type: select, options: ["Human review and editing", "Multi-reviewer consensus", "Automated quality checks", "Customer satisfaction correlation"]}

## Example Dataset Structure

{type: information, icon: "code", title: "Training Data Format"}

Here's how your training data should be structured:

```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "id": "example_001",
      "customer_input": "Your product doesn't work and I'm frustrated!",
      "ideal_response": "I'm really sorry to hear you're having trouble with our product, and I completely understand your frustration. Let me help you resolve this right away. Could you tell me specifically what issue you're experiencing so I can provide the most effective solution?",
      "tags": ["complaint", "frustration", "technical_issue"],
      "quality_score": 9.2
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Elements:**
- **Customer Input:** The original message or question
- **Ideal Response:** Your improved, polite response
- **Tags:** Categories for organizing and filtering
- **Quality Score:** Rating for response effectiveness

## Quality Assurance Checklist

{type: information, icon: "check-circle", title: "Pre-Training Validation"}

Before proceeding to fine-tuning, verify your dataset meets these standards:

- ✅ All responses demonstrate clear improvements over base model
- ✅ Consistent tone and style across all examples
- ✅ Factual accuracy maintained in all responses
- ✅ Appropriate length and detail level
- ✅ Cultural sensitivity and inclusivity considered
- ✅ Edge cases and error scenarios included
- ✅ Balanced representation of different customer types
