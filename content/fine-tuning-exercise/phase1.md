## Instructions

{type: instructions}

In this phase, you'll evaluate the current base model to understand its strengths and weaknesses. Your goal is to identify specific areas where the model needs improvement, particularly in terms of politeness and customer interaction quality.

**Your Tasks:**
1. Define key requirements for a polite chatbot
2. Analyze example conversations
3. Identify problematic response patterns
4. Document improvement opportunities

## Requirements Definition

{type: selection, multiple: true, title: "Select Key Requirements"}

Select all key requirements for our polite chatbot:

- Maintain politeness in all customer interactions
- Provide accurate and helpful information  
- Handle customer complaints with grace and empathy
- Use appropriate tone and professional language
- Avoid unnecessary technical jargon
- Acknowledge customer emotions and frustrations
- Offer personalized assistance when possible
- Maintain consistency across all interactions

## Base Model Testing

{type: information, icon: "comments", title: "Current Model Performance"}

Here are examples of how the current base model responds to customer inquiries:

**Example 1:**
- **Customer:** "Your product doesn't work and I'm frustrated!"
- **Current AI:** "Please check the troubleshooting guide in the documentation."
- **Issues:** Lacks empathy, impersonal tone, no emotional acknowledgment

**Example 2:**
- **Customer:** "I've been waiting for support for hours. This is unacceptable!"
- **Current AI:** "Support tickets are processed in order. Check your ticket status online."
- **Issues:** Dismissive, no apology, doesn't address frustration

**Example 3:**
- **Customer:** "Can you help me understand how to use this feature?"
- **Current AI:** "Read the user manual section 4.2.3."
- **Issues:** Unhelpful, doesn't offer direct assistance, impersonal

**Which aspects of politeness are most important for customer service?**
{type: select, options: ["Acknowledging emotions", "Using please/thank you", "Apologizing for inconvenience", "All of the above"]}

### Expected Outcomes

**After fine-tuning, what improvements do you expect to see?**

## Key Insights

{type: information, icon: "lightbulb", title: "Analysis Summary"}

Based on your evaluation, the base model demonstrates several clear areas for improvement:

- **Emotional Intelligence:** The model doesn't recognize or respond to customer emotions
- **Communication Style:** Responses are functional but lack warmth and empathy  
- **Helpfulness:** The model provides minimal assistance rather than proactive support
- **Personalization:** Interactions feel robotic rather than human-like

These insights will guide our fine-tuning approach in the next phases.
