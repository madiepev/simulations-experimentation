## Instructions

{type: instructions}

With your dataset prepared, it's time to execute the fine-tuning process. This phase involves configuring hyperparameters, setting up the training pipeline, and monitoring the training process.

**Your Tasks:**
1. Arrange the fine-tuning workflow steps in correct order
2. Configure training parameters
3. Set up monitoring and evaluation metrics
4. Plan the training execution strategy

## Fine-Tuning Process Overview

{type: information, icon: "cogs", title: "Supervised Fine-Tuning Workflow"}

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts a pre-trained model to your specific use case by training it on task-specific examples. The process involves:

**Key Concepts:**
- **Base Model:** The pre-trained foundation model you're improving
- **Training Data:** Your curated dataset of input-output pairs
- **Hyperparameters:** Settings that control the training process
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures to assess training progress and quality
- **Checkpoints:** Saved model states during training

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Improved response quality in your target domain
- Better alignment with desired communication style
- Maintained general capabilities while gaining specialized skills

## Workflow Sequencing

{type: ranking, title: "Arrange Fine-Tuning Steps in Correct Order"}

Drag and drop these workflow steps into the correct sequence:

```
Monitor training progress and loss curves
Validate dataset format and quality
Configure hyperparameters and training settings
Load the base model and tokenizer
Split dataset into training and validation sets
Initialize training pipeline and environment
Save and export the fine-tuned model
Run training loop with periodic evaluation
Prepare final model for deployment testing
Set up logging and checkpoint management
```
